# Address Book
* This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) Address Book application. 
* It is a Ruby sample application demonstrating classes, blocks, methods, variables and more.
* It allows users to put in names and information in order to create contacts that can then be searched for.
* Uses the Ruby Standard Library to display a user interface and remember user input between sessions.
* It provides reasonably well-written code and is a great example of object oriented programming.

## Usage
First, download the files. Once in the directory, you can type in this command prompt in order to start using the address book.  

```shell script
ruby address-book.rb
```
